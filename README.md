# defn-debug

A Clojure library that gives an alternative defn that provides toggle-able printing of args and results of functions declared with it.
In most cases repl driven development would be preferable to find this information, and this should never be used outside of debugging.
There are some situations where something like this is super handy though, so I made a small library for it.

## Usage
defnp currently does not work on [multi arity functions](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/functions.html#multi-arity-functions), though it does work with [variadic functions](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/functions.html#variadic-functions).

* Define functions with `defnp`, example:
```
(defnp grr [a b ] (a b b))
```

* Ensure that `defn-debug-enabled` is `def`'d and truthy, example:
```
(def defn-debug-enabled true)
```
If `defn-debug-enabled` is undefined functions defined with `defnp`  will simply not log debug output. 


Here is an example of usage.
``` lisp
defn-debug.core> (defnp grr [a b ] (a b b))
#'defn-debug.core/grr
defn-debug.core> (grr + 1)
2
defn-debug.core> (def defn-debug-enabled nil)
#'defn-debug.core/defn-debug-enabled
defn-debug.core> (grr + 1)
2
defn-debug.core> (def defn-debug-enabled true)
#'defn-debug.core/defn-debug-enabled
defn-debug.core> (grr + 1)
{:fn-name #function[defn-debug.core/grr], :fn-args [#function[clojure.core/+] 1], :defn-env nil, :exec-point invocation}
{:fn-name #function[defn-debug.core/grr], :fn-return 2, :exec-point return}
2
```
